The requirement document of Agenda:

	Besides the applications that was pointed out by the former head files,
this edition of Agenda, that is Agenda_beta, has been added two important
applications: 
*1. the changing of the information of the users:
	it contains:
			the changing of password, email and phone number
		    To make it more secure, the users have to input the password again
		to insure that the one who want to change the user's information is the
		user himself(herself) before changing.
*2. the improvement of the User Interface:
	it contains:
			the welcome page, CU page, help page and more warning for illegal operation.
		And in the last edition of Agenda, when inputing a single number, if the string
		input is not a number, the collapse of the program would be caused. This time 
		we improve the program's ability to deal with the illegal input.
